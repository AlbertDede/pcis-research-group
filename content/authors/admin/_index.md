Ing. Prof.  Emmanuel Kofi Akowuah is a result-oriented, highly skilled Electrical & Electronic Engineer registered with the Ghana Institution of Engineers (GhIE). He is also a member of the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE), the world’s largest technical professional organization. He is currently an Associate Professor at the Department of Computer Engineering at the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (KNUST) and a fellow of The Brew-Hammond Energy Center (TBHEC), a multi-disciplinary research Centre at the College of Engineering, KNUST.

Ing. Prof. Akowuah has a Ph.D. in Electronic Engineering from the University of Kent, England, where he produced several novel surface plasmon resonance sensor designs for various applications. Prior to this, he obtained an MSc in Broadband and Mobile Communication Networks from the University of Kent and a BSc in Electrical and Electronic Engineering from Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (KNUST), Kumasi, Ghana. 

He has over 10 years of engineering practice experience with a broad set of technical skills ranging from wireless and optical communication systems, enterprise software solutions, secured network and distributed systems, artificial intelligence, intelligent energy systems and renewable energy solutions. His research interests include finite element modeling of photonic devices, photonic crystal optical fibres, surface plasmon polaritons, high-speed optical communication systems and devices, wireless communication systems, grid-connected systems, hybrid Photovoltaic (PV) energy systems and intelligent energy management systems. He has extensive research publications in reputable international journals in these areas. In 2009, he received the IEEE UK/RI Communication Chapter MSc. Prize for his outstanding performance during his MSc. degree, where he designed a novel optical fibre for high-speed communication systems with exceptional performance properties.

Besides his professional and academic contributions, he has provided consultancy services to a number of reputable engineering firms and has successfully executed several high-value engineering projects some of which include payment solutions, enterprise resource planning, Wide Area Networks (WANs), learning management solutions, intelligent energy management systems and grid-connected PV solutions. Furthermore, he has extensive experience in leading multi-disciplinary teams on high-value projects sponsored by both local and international donors.
